# SuiBets Platform - Crypto Sports Betting Platform

## Overview
SuiBets is a crypto sports betting platform built on the Sui blockchain, offering real-time betting across 30+ sports. It integrates multiple sports APIs for live scores and automated event tracking, utilizing blockchain for secure transactions and PostgreSQL for data persistence. The platform aims to provide a comprehensive and robust betting experience.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (custom themed)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **UI Components**: Radix UI
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query
- **Routing**: Wouter

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API**: RESTful design with sport-specific modules
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live score updates
- **Data Aggregation**: Multi-API with resilience and fallback
- **Authentication**: Session-based with optional blockchain authentication

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (Railway hosted)
- **Caching**: In-memory for performance
- **Authentication State**: Session storage

### Key Features
- **Sports Data Integration**: Aggregates data from API-Sports and SportsData API across various sports with an event tracking service and API resilience.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes the Sui blockchain for secure transactions, supports SBETS token, and employs Move smart contracts for betting operations, with multiple wallet support.
- **Betting System**: Provides real-time odds, multiple market types, live betting via WebSockets, betting slip management, and automated payout through smart contracts.
- **User Management**: Features wallet-based authentication, user profiles, balance management for SUI and SBETS tokens, and secure session handling.

### Data Flow
- **Event Data Pipeline**: Involves data aggregation, normalization, event tracking, real-time updates via WebSocket, and caching.
- **Betting Flow (On-Chain)**: Users select markets, odds are calculated, bets are placed via Sui smart contracts (user signs `place_bet` transaction), confirmed transactions are recorded in PostgreSQL, and settlements are automated.
- **Authentication Flow**: Wallet connection, address verification, session creation, balance synchronization from blockchain, and transaction authorization.

### Architecture Model
- **Full On-Chain Model**: Users place bets directly on the smart contract. Bets are tracked in PostgreSQL for UI, and settlements are automated on-chain. Revenue is withdrawn by admin.
  - **Admin Wallet (owns AdminCap)**: `0x20850db591c4d575b5238baf975e54580d800e69b8b5b421de796a311d3bea50`
  - **Treasury**: Managed by smart contract at BettingPlatform shared object

#### Fund Flow - FULL ON-CHAIN DUAL TOKEN SYSTEM

**SUI Bets (On-Chain via Smart Contract):**
1. **User places bet** → `place_bet` - SUI goes directly to contract treasury_sui
2. **If Bet WON** → `settle_bet` pays user from contract treasury (1% fee on profit)
3. **If Bet LOST** → Stake stays in contract treasury (added to `accrued_fees_sui`)
4. **Admin can** → Call `withdraw_fees` to withdraw SUI platform revenue

**SBETS Bets (On-Chain via Smart Contract):**
1. **User places bet** → `place_bet_sbets` - SBETS goes directly to contract treasury_sbets
2. **If Bet WON** → `settle_bet_sbets` pays user from SBETS treasury (1% fee on profit)
3. **If Bet LOST** → Stake stays in SBETS treasury (added to `accrued_fees_sbets`)
4. **Admin can** → Call `withdraw_fees_sbets` to withdraw SBETS platform revenue

- **Key Point**: BOTH SUI and SBETS use smart contract for settlements (full on-chain).
- **Gas Payment**: Users pay gas for bets. Platform pays gas for on-chain settlements.
- **Dual Treasury**: Contract maintains separate treasuries and liability tracking for SUI and SBETS.

### Monitoring Endpoints
- `/api/contract/info`: Provides blockchain contract details.
- `/api/settlement/status`: Reports on the settlement worker's status.
- `/api/user/balance?userId=<wallet>`: Fetches user SUI and SBETS balances.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Railway Deployment**: Recommended, requires specific environment variables for database, blockchain configuration, on-chain payouts (optional `ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` for automated withdrawals), sports data, and session security.
- **Vercel Compatibility**: Alternative for serverless functions and static asset optimization.
- **Configuration Management**: Uses environment variables for secrets, network configuration, fee structure, and wallet addresses.

## Recent Changes (January 6, 2026)

### 80-Minute Betting Cutoff Security (Server-Authoritative)
- **Fail-Closed Architecture**: All bet validation paths reject on uncertainty
- **Unified Event Registry**: Checks both live and upcoming caches via `lookupEventSync()`
- **Server-Authoritative**: Client flags (isLive, matchMinute) are IGNORED - server determines event status
- **Security Flow**:
  1. Event NOT found in ANY cache → REJECT
  2. Cache age > 2 minutes (universal) → REJECT
  3. LIVE cache entry: Cache > 60s → REJECT, Minute undefined → REJECT, Minute >= 80 → REJECT
  4. UPCOMING cache entry: startTime passed (shouldBeLive) → REJECT
  5. Cache access error → REJECT
- **Bypass Prevention**:
  - Stale cache manipulation: Universal 2-min stale check
  - Client lies about isLive: Server checks live cache first
  - Fresh upcoming cache but match started: startTime comparison
  - Missing minute data: Explicitly rejected as unverifiable
- **Rejection Codes**: `EVENT_NOT_FOUND`, `STALE_EVENT_DATA`, `STALE_MATCH_DATA`, `UNVERIFIABLE_MATCH_TIME`, `MATCH_TIME_EXCEEDED`, `EVENT_STATUS_UNCERTAIN`, `EVENT_VERIFICATION_ERROR`

### 100% Real Odds Implementation
- **Background Prefetcher**: Continuously fetches odds every 60 seconds to warm cache
- **Pre-warmed Cache**: Odds cached per fixture ID with 5-minute TTL for instant responses
- **Event Filtering**: Only displays events with `oddsSource === 'api-sports'` (real API odds)
- **Result**: 100% of displayed events have real API odds - events without bookmaker coverage are filtered out
- **Performance**: Cached responses in ~150-400ms vs 27s for fresh fetch

### API-Sports Odds Coverage
- Live events: ~89% have real odds (16/18 typical)
- Upcoming events: ~64% have real odds (159/250 typical)
- Events without odds (smaller leagues without bookmaker coverage) are not displayed
- This is an API limitation, not a bug - smaller leagues don't have bookmaker odds available

### Auto-Payment Settlement System (January 6, 2026) - PRODUCTION READY
- **Status**: WORKING - On-chain settlement verified with real bets
- **BetObjectId Extraction**: Fixed in `useOnChainBet.ts`
  - Uses `suiClient.waitForTransaction()` with `showObjectChanges: true`
  - Successfully extracts Bet object ID from transaction effects
  - Verified: Bet ID 17 has betObjectId `0x503c030e...`
- **Fee Calculation**: 1% fee on PROFIT only (matching smart contract)
  - Formula: `platformFee = profit * 0.01` where `profit = grossPayout - stake`
- **Settlement Worker Flow**:
  1. Bets WITH `betObjectId` → On-chain settlement via `settle_bet_admin` / `settle_bet_sbets_admin`
  2. Legacy bets WITHOUT `betObjectId` → Off-chain fallback (database credits - acceptable for transition)
- **Verified On-Chain Settlements**: 2 SBETS bets settled from treasury with TX hashes logged
- **Treasury Status**: SUI ~2.95 SUI, SBETS ~5.0M (check `/api/contract/info` for current)

### 100% Odds Coverage via Separate Live/Upcoming Endpoints (January 7, 2026)
- **Architecture Decision**: Use SEPARATE endpoints for live vs upcoming events per API-Football documentation
- **Live Events**:
  1. Primary: `/odds/live` endpoint - bulk fetch of ALL live in-play odds
  2. Fallback: `/odds?fixture=X` for individual fixtures if live endpoint misses any
  3. Result: Real-time in-play odds for live matches
- **Upcoming Events**:
  1. `/odds/mapping` to identify fixtures with pre-match odds available
  2. `/odds?fixture=X` for individual fixture odds
  3. Result: Pre-match bookmaker odds for upcoming matches
- **Result**: 100% of displayed events have real API odds (events without odds are filtered out)
- **Efficiency Improvements**:
  - Live events: Single bulk API call to `/odds/live` instead of N individual calls
  - Upcoming events: Only fetch odds for fixtures in mapping (saves API calls)
  - Checks ALL bookmakers (not just first) for Match Winner market
- **Major League Coverage**: Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, etc. have 100% bookmaker coverage
- **Files Changed**: `server/routes-simple.ts`, `server/services/apiSportsService.ts`
