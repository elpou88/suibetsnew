# SuiBets Platform - Crypto Sports Betting Platform

## Overview
SuiBets is a crypto sports betting platform built on the Sui blockchain, offering real-time betting across 30+ sports. It integrates multiple sports APIs for live scores and automated event tracking, utilizing blockchain for secure transactions and PostgreSQL for data persistence. The platform aims to provide a comprehensive and robust betting experience.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (custom themed)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **UI Components**: Radix UI
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query
- **Routing**: Wouter

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API**: RESTful design with sport-specific modules
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live score updates
- **Data Aggregation**: Multi-API with resilience and fallback
- **Authentication**: Session-based with optional blockchain authentication

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (Railway hosted)
- **Caching**: In-memory for performance
- **Authentication State**: Session storage

### Key Features
- **Sports Data Integration**: Aggregates data from API-Sports and SportsData API across various sports with an event tracking service and API resilience.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes the Sui blockchain for secure transactions, supports SBETS token, and employs Move smart contracts for betting operations, with multiple wallet support.
- **Betting System**: Provides real-time odds, multiple market types, live betting via WebSockets, betting slip management, and automated payout through smart contracts.
- **User Management**: Features wallet-based authentication, user profiles, balance management for SUI and SBETS tokens, and secure session handling.

### Data Flow
- **Event Data Pipeline**: Involves data aggregation, normalization, event tracking, real-time updates via WebSocket, and caching.
- **Betting Flow (On-Chain)**: Users select markets, odds are calculated, bets are placed via Sui smart contracts (user signs `place_bet` transaction), confirmed transactions are recorded in PostgreSQL, and settlements are automated.
- **Authentication Flow**: Wallet connection, address verification, session creation, balance synchronization from blockchain, and transaction authorization.

### Architecture Model
- **Full On-Chain Model**: Users place bets directly on the smart contract. Bets are tracked in PostgreSQL for UI, and settlements are automated on-chain. Revenue is withdrawn by admin.
  - **Admin Wallet (owns AdminCap)**: `0x20850db591c4d575b5238baf975e54580d800e69b8b5b421de796a311d3bea50`
  - **Treasury**: Managed by smart contract at BettingPlatform shared object

#### Fund Flow - FULL ON-CHAIN DUAL TOKEN SYSTEM

**SUI Bets (On-Chain via Smart Contract):**
1. **User places bet** → `place_bet` - SUI goes directly to contract treasury_sui
2. **If Bet WON** → `settle_bet` pays user from contract treasury (1% fee on profit)
3. **If Bet LOST** → Stake stays in contract treasury (added to `accrued_fees_sui`)
4. **Admin can** → Call `withdraw_fees` to withdraw SUI platform revenue

**SBETS Bets (On-Chain via Smart Contract):**
1. **User places bet** → `place_bet_sbets` - SBETS goes directly to contract treasury_sbets
2. **If Bet WON** → `settle_bet_sbets` pays user from SBETS treasury (1% fee on profit)
3. **If Bet LOST** → Stake stays in SBETS treasury (added to `accrued_fees_sbets`)
4. **Admin can** → Call `withdraw_fees_sbets` to withdraw SBETS platform revenue

- **Key Point**: BOTH SUI and SBETS use smart contract for settlements (full on-chain).
- **Gas Payment**: Users pay gas for bets. Platform pays gas for on-chain settlements.
- **Dual Treasury**: Contract maintains separate treasuries and liability tracking for SUI and SBETS.

### Monitoring Endpoints
- `/api/contract/info`: Provides blockchain contract details.
- `/api/settlement/status`: Reports on the settlement worker's status.
- `/api/user/balance?userId=<wallet>`: Fetches user SUI and SBETS balances.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Railway Deployment**: Recommended, requires specific environment variables for database, blockchain configuration, on-chain payouts (optional `ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` for automated withdrawals), sports data, and session security.
- **Vercel Compatibility**: Alternative for serverless functions and static asset optimization.
- **Configuration Management**: Uses environment variables for secrets, network configuration, fee structure, and wallet addresses.
