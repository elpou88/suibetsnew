1. Football / Soccer

Best websites to scrape:

Flashscore
 – Live scores, fixtures, results, standings.

Sofascore
 – Detailed live stats, player data.

ESPN Soccer
 – Match results and fixtures.

Soccerway
 – Historical data and fixtures.

Tips:

Flashscore & Sofascore have highly dynamic JS, so you may need headless browsers (e.g., Selenium, Playwright) or reverse-engineer their internal JSON endpoints via network tab.

ESPN and Soccerway are easier for static scraping; use BeautifulSoup or Requests.

2. Basketball

Best websites to scrape:

NBA.com
 – Fixtures, results, stats.

ESPN Basketball
 – Live results, schedules.

Basketball Reference
 – Historical stats, player/team data.

Tips:

NBA.com provides JSON endpoints for live games; check network requests in dev tools for /scoreboard JSON.

Basketball Reference is mainly static HTML, easy to parse.

3. Tennis

Best websites to scrape:

ATP Tour
 – Player results, fixtures.

Tennis Live Scores
 – Live matches across all tournaments.

ESPN Tennis
 – Fixtures, results, rankings.

Tips:

Flashscore for tennis has a unified endpoint across all sports; once you scrape tennis data, you can reuse similar methods for football/basketball.

4. Cricket

Best websites to scrape:

Cricbuzz
 – Live scores, fixtures.

ESPN Cricinfo
 – Detailed stats, player info.

CricketAPI pages
 – Some free endpoints, unofficial.

Tips:

Cricbuzz uses dynamic JS; network tab reveals JSON endpoints for live matches.

Cricinfo pages are mostly static for past results; live scores often require JS rendering.

5. American Football / NFL

Best websites to scrape:

NFL.com
 – Fixtures, live scores.

ESPN NFL
 – Live scores, stats.

Pro-Football Reference
 – Historical stats, player data.

Tips:

ESPN JSON endpoints for scoreboard data are easier than parsing HTML.

Pro-Football Reference is mostly static; ideal for historical stats.

6. Multi-Sport / All Sports

Best websites to scrape:

Flashscore
 – Covers football, basketball, tennis, hockey, rugby, cricket, motorsports.

Sofascore
 – Covers almost every sport in live scoring.

ESPN
 – Multiple sports, but may be slower and less structured than Flashscore.

Tips:

Flashscore/Sofascore are your best bets if you want all sports in one place.

Both use JS-heavy pages, but the live data is often delivered via JSON/XHR endpoints you can reverse-engineer.

Use a headless browser (Selenium/Playwright) if scraping HTML directly becomes messy.
