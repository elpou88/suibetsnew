Suibets – Phase 1 (Tech Breakdown)

Phase 1 is about proving a new betting surface, not scaling yet.

We focused on rendering on TV while keeping everything stateless, safe, and on-chain aware.

1️⃣ Stateless UI, On-Chain Truth

The TV app itself does not hold user state.

No private keys on TV

No wallets stored on device

No session persistence locally

Instead, the TV client:

Reads on-chain objects

Reacts to live match events

Renders only what is currently valid

This dramatically reduces attack surface and makes TV a read + intent layer, not a custody layer.

2️⃣ Object-Based Betting (Sui Native)

Each bet opportunity is an object, not a mutable global state.

Bet = discrete on-chain object

Time-bound

Context-bound (specific live moment)

Immutable once resolved

This is why:

Bets only appear during live moments

Once the match ends, new bets cannot exist

No race conditions or post-match exploits

This model is only practical because of Sui’s object-centric design.

3️⃣ One-Click TV Betting via dApp Session

The TV app is fully powered by your existing Suibets dApp session.

Flow:

User authenticates on mobile/web

Session is mirrored on-chain

TV app reads that session

User confirms bets with a single action

The TV never signs transactions directly — it requests intent, the session executes on-chain.

4️⃣ Live Rendering Engine

The UI is event-driven, not static.

Live match feeds trigger bet objects

UI components spawn only when conditions are valid

Odds, timers, and availability are enforced on-chain

No live match = no bet surface.
No valid object = nothing to render.

5️⃣ Why This Is Phase 1

Phase 1 proves:

TV as a first-class Web3 interface

Stateless UX can still feel instant

On-chain rules can drive UI availability

We intentionally did not optimize for scale or liquidity yet.

Next phases will add:

Extension upgrades

More bet types

Deeper session control

Cross-device continuity

TL;DR (Short Version)

Phase 1 is:

Stateless TV UI

Object-based live bets

On-chain session powered

Context-aware rendering
